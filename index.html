		<p>First of all, Ed Sheeran. Hes a really talented singer, and a handsome person too, he was already homeles and all the lyrics of his musics are about his own life!<br>
		</p><p>Then we Have Khalid. Hes young, but since his 18, he started to become really famous, having musics that were on 1 of more listened on UK for days. <br>
		</p><p>Demi is one of the most famous from the list, but still worthy the honor. her voice is soulful and strong, and she's classy and funny too<br>
		</p><p>About Kivitz... It's complicated, but we will talk about him later
